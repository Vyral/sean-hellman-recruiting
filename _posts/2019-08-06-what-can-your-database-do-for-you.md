Your business is your database and your database is your business. **It’s so important to build this database and put all the people who know, like, and trust you in one place.&nbsp;**

The first step to building this database is to have a contact management system. We use Commissions Inc. as our platform to help build our agents’ businesses.&nbsp;

**Next, you need to add leads to your database daily.** These can be friends, business associates, internet leads, open house leads, past client lead, and even vendors. Everyone that knows you should go into this database.&nbsp;

**You should communicate with your database either daily, weekly, or monthly.** I send out two video blogs to my sphere of influence with the help of Vyral Marketing. It’s a way of adding value, updating people on what’s going on in the marketplace, and staying on top of many other tasks essential to educating and connecting with your database.&nbsp;

Make sure you’re building that sphere of influence along the way and consistently asking for referrals. **The key is in the follow up because there is more money made there than on the first contact. It’s all about being consistent and bringing value.**

If you have any questions for me in the meantime about your database or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
